# ARAM Portal Reminder

ARAM has portals now, and some people tend to forget to use them, taking ages to walk across the bridge instead.  
This little thing fixes that!

## Usage

- Download the .exe from [Releases](https://github.com/DidiSkywalker/aram-portal-reminder/releases)
- Start the League of Legends Client 
- Run it in a command line like so `.\aram-portal-reminder.exe`

The program periodically checks the [LCU API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#league-client-api), and if you die in an ARAM game, it will kindly remind you to use the portal once you respawn :)
